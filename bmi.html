<h1 id="heading">CALCULATE YOUR BODY MASS INDEX</h1>


<p id="aboutbmi">  The BMI is a convenient rule of thumb used to broadly categorize a person as underweight, 
normal weight, overweight, or obese based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height.One study found that BMI had a good general correlation with body fat percentage, and noted that obesity has overtaken smoking as the world's number one cause of death.<br> 
Commonly accepted BMI ranges are 
<ul><li>underweight (under 18.5 kg/m2)<li> normal weight (18.5 to 25)<li> 
overweight (25 to 30) <li> obese (over 30).</ul> </p>
